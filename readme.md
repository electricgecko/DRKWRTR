DRKWRTR
=======

*Writing environment for slaves on a brutalist spaceship.*

DRKWRTR is a very simple writing app I created for myself, mostly to write entries for my blog. While I use the excellent [IA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/) for most writing tasks, I wanted something with a dark theme and just the right amount of formatting features to work with my custom and weird blog format.

DRKWRTR uses **Markdown** for formatting sanity. Press **ALT+e** to toggle your text between Markdown source and HTML output. Press **ALT+r** to wipe your document.

For now, DRKWRTR supports just a single document. It uses local storage on a per-browser basis to save and retrieve your data. It does so automatically once you stop writing. A filled dot in the bottom left corner (desktop)/upper right corner (mobile) indicates a saved document.

Documents can be converted into a publicly visible document with permalink URL by pressing **ALT+w**. This works for both the Markdown source and rendered HTML.

An instance of the app is publicly running at [drkwrtr.co](http://drkwrtr.co).
