DRKWRTR
=======

A very simple writing environment I created for myself, mostly to write entries for my blog. While I use the excellent [IA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/) for most writing tasks, I wanted something with a dark theme and just the right amount of formatting features to work with my custom and weird blog format.

DRKWRTR uses **Markdown** for formatting sanity. Press **ALT+Return** to toggle your text between  Markdown source and HTML output.

For now, DRKWRTR supports just a single document. It uses local storage on a per-browser basis to save and retrieve your data. It does so automatically once you stop writing. A filled dot in the bottom left corner (desktop)/upper right corner (mobile) indicates a saved document.

### Plugins & dependencies
* **Autosize** by Jack Moore – http://www.jacklmoore.com/autosize
* **Idle Timer** by Paul Irish — https://github.com/thorst/jquery-idletimer
* **Markdown.js** by Dominic Baggott— https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js

I'll happily answer any questions. Feedback is always appreciated, naturally.
