DRKWRTR
=======

A very simple writing environment I created for myself, mostly to write entries to blog. While I use the excellent [IA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/) for most writing tasks, it is lacking a dark theme and just the right amount of formatting features to work with my custom and weird blog format.

DRKWRTR uses **Markdown** for formatting sanity. Using the **ALT+Return** combination, text can be toggled between its Markdown source and HTML output.

DRKWRTR supports only a single document. It uses local storage on a per-browser basis to save and retrieve your data. It does so automatically once the user stops writing.

### Plugins & dependencies

I'll happily answer any questions. Feedback is always appreciated, naturally.
